<li><strong>Commander ships:</strong> When a commander ship is present, it increases the damage dealt by all enemy ships.</li>
<li> <strong>Anti-air ship:</strong> Enemy ships with anti-aircraft guns that can damage your planes.
Your planes have the ability to dodge enemy AA ship fire. Dodge chance depends on the plane, the Air Power stat of the carrier that launched the plane, and the Anti-Air stat of the enemy AA ship.
Each plane has a "Max Dodge" stat (please check equipment info). When attacked by an AA ship, the Max Dodge of the plane represents the maximum chance of dodging that one attack (not necessarily current dodge chance).</li>
<li><strong>Repair ships:</strong> Repair ships will continually heal the enemy ships.
Repair ships are classified by S-class and A-class; they heal a single ship and the entire enemy fleet, respectively.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Air Superiority Value</strong> is determined by the Aviation stat of your ships and number of aircraft they carry(including fighters, dive bombers, torpedo bombers and float planes but excluding ASW planes). All ships sortied contribute to this value, even if the fleet they are in do not fight. However, if a ship contributing to the value leaves the battlefield for any reason, the Air Superiority stat of your fleet is reduced.

<li>The level of the ships also affect the value. The formation of fleet does not.

<li>Enemy fleets also have <strong>Air Superiority Values</strong>. It can be lowered by depending on the AA stat of your fleet. 

<li>Each map will have it's own recommended <strong>Air Superiority Value</strong>. If this value is exceeded before entering the map then it results it automatic Air Supremacy.

<li>During a mission, depending on the relative value of friendly and enemy Air Superiority stat, the one of the following 6 effects apply:
<ul>

<li><strong>Air Incapability (AI)</strong>: Aviation damage dealt by friendly ships is reduced by 20%, aviation damage suffered by friendly ships is increased by 10%. Accuracy and evasion is reduced by 8% (does not affect DoT effects like burn or flooding).

<li><strong>Air Denial (AD)</strong>: Aviation damage dealt by friendly ships is reduced by 12%, aviation damage suffered by friendly ships is increased by 6%. Accuracy and evasion is reduced by 3% (does not affect DoT effects like burn or flooding).

<li><strong>Air Parity (AP)</strong>: Aviation damage dealt by friendly ships is increased by 6%, aviation damage received is reduced by 3% (does not affect DoT effects like burn or flooding).

<li><strong>Air Superiority (AS)</strong>: Aviation damage dealt by friendly ships is increased by 12%, aviation damage suffered by friendly ships is reduced by 6%. Accuracy is increased by 5%, ambush chance is reduced by 5% (does not affect DoT effects like burn or flooding).

<li><strong>Air Supremacy (AS+)</strong>: Aviation damage dealt by friendly ships is increased by 20%, aviation damage suffered by friendly ships is reduced by 10%. Accuracy increased by 10%, ambush chance is reduced by 8% (does not affect DoT effects like burn or flooding).
