## Ship JSON files

If you want to help contribute in building ship pages, use this json template https://github.com/alg-wiki/wikia/blob/master/Ships/aurora.json and use a json online editor like this https://jsoneditoronline.org/. Just replace the values with the ff:

Some are self explanatory so I did not include them here


```json
"file_id": ""
```
Should have a value with this format <3 digit id>_<shipname with starting capital letter>
  
  
```json
"1":{},
"2":{},
```
This usually applies to items where you can have more than one of it like skins, expressions, skills, lines. If you want to add one, just increment the number from the last one while keeping format. eg. "3":{},


```json
"stats":{}
```
If the bote does not have a retrofit, do not remove the "100retrofit" and "120retrofit" part, just leave the values blank. eg. ""


```json
"equipmentLoadout": {
    "1": {
      "type": "CL Main Gun",
      "efficiency": "125%/127%/130%/135%",
      "amount": "1/1/1/1",
      "preload": "0/0/0/0"
    },
```
Efficiency, amount, and preload values are based on limit break ranks, being rank0/rank1/rank2/rank3. Enclose retrofit values on parenthesis. eg. retrofit has +5% MG on 2nd rank, "125%/127%/130%(135%)/135%(140%)


```json
"drop": {
    "droppable": "false"
```
Set to false if it doesn't drop to any map, world or events. 


```json
"list": {
      "1": {
        "event": "World",
 ```
The map or "event" that contains chapters and nodes. For example if the bote also drops on Crimson Echoes, add: "2": { "event": "Crimson Echoes",


```json
"chapter": {
          "1": {
            "label": "Ch.2",
```
The chapters in the "event". For "World", the label should be the chapter names, eg. "Ch.2". For events, the label should be "AX" or "BX" 


```json
"node": {
              "1": {
                "drop": "✓",
                "note": "JP Only"
              }
```
The nodes pertain to the playable stages inside the chapter. YOU SHOULD INCLUDE ALL NODES of a chapter in the json file even though the bote does not drop on that node. Just mark the "drop" as "-" instead of "✓"


```json
"lines": {
    "skin": {
      "1": {
        "label": "Default",
        "dialogue": {
          "1": {
            "event": "Ship Description",
            "media": "",
            "chinese": "",
            "chineseTL": "",
            "chineseNote": "",
            "japanese": "",
            "japaneseTL": "",
            "japaneseNote": "",
            "english": "",
            "englishNote": ""
          }
```
Each skin has its own different set of lines. If you notice the template, aurora has 3 skins so on the "skin": {"1"} part, you see this repeated 3 times. The "label" is the skin name but this doesn't appear on the page yet but make sure to fill it up with the correct details. the "media" corresponds to the "event" so this needs to be left as it is but if you are willing to help with the media files (in the section below) you can actually edit this to the filename of the sound file. Notes are to be implemented soon but there are already fields for it in the json file.

## Media files

If you have extra time to assemble the media files as well, you can check the file structure from this link https://mega.nz/#!1Q9mWSZR!qpC2DluKhYgfq1LrT3ofW_9Tm0LhpaSV7zB9dqk5Sd4. It contains the format of the file names as well as the image resolutions. 

Also a few notes
- For sprites, get full resolution as much as possible, if you're ripping it from the current english wiki, be sure to get the original resolution since the one posted in the pages are scaled. 
- If you try and compress an image for size, be sure to compare the pixel quality to the original.

## Patch Notes

Compose a markdown using this website 
- http://demo.showdownjs.com/

The left pane is where you input the code, the right is the visuals it shows. After you are finised, copy the code from the left and paste it in a notepad then save it as:
````
"<yyyy>_<mm>_<dd>_patch_<server>.txt" 
````
and put it on: 
````
Patchnotes/<server>/
````
Then update the json file of the corresponding server at the json directory adding a line to the new file 
```json
{
	"1": {
		"filename": "2019_02_14_patch_jp",
		"title": "Valentines Patch",
		"date": "2019/02/14"
	}
}
```
to
```json
{
	"1": {
		"filename": "2019_02_14_patch_jp",
		"title": "Valentines Patch",
		"date": "2019/02/14"
	},
  "2": {
		"filename": "2019_02_21_patch_jp",
		"title": "x3 Hard mode",
		"date": "2019/02/21"
	}
}
```
